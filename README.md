## What is *potence*?

*potence* is a tiny modularized JavaScript library containing a variety of convenience functions related
to common data types like strings, numbers, objects, or arrays. Unfortunately, JavaScript lacks a comprehensive
standard library, which is why implementing seemingly basic functionality can sometimes be quite a hassle.
You often find yourself writing the same utility functions over and over in different projects.

*potence* takes that job out of your hands and provides you with all the functions that you'd expect any
mature language to have intrinsically and more.

## Why would you use *potence*?

### *potence* is tiny and has no dependencies

All functionality in *potence* is completely implemented in native JavaScript. While *potence*
does sport quite a few functions, its modular nature allows for tree-shaking, so **you only
pay for what you actually use**, drastically reducing overall bundle size.

### Full test coverage

All available functions are supported by unit tests. Even the utility types offered to TypeScript
users have full test coverage thanks to [`ts-morph`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph).

### Open to contributions and improvements

The modularity of modern JavaScript build systems allows us to add an infinite number of
new functions and modules without impacting the final bundle size at all. As such, *potence*
constantly strives to add more common functionality and eliminate potential bugs. For this
it relies on user feedback, so don't be afraid to open an issue on github if you notice a bug
or have an idea for an improvement! Be sure to read the contribution guidelines below if you
have a feature request.

### Full TypeScript integration

*potence* is built entirely on TypeScript. You don't *have* to use TypeScript to use *potence*, of course,
but if you do you'll be able to benefit from full type coverage. *potence* even offers some utility
types to represent things like abstract constructors, instantiable constructors, or object literals.

## Docs

[Click here for the full documentation](https://cengels.github.io/potence/).

Currently there are nine modules contained in this library:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Arrays | Array comparisons and common functions like <ul><li>`Arrays.next([8, 1, -5], 2) => 8`</li><li>`Arrays.last([3, 6]) => 6`</li><li>`Arrays.replace([3, 6], 6, 9) => [3, 9]`</li></ul> |
| List | A class that extends `Array` to get all the functions in the `Arrays` module on the type itself. <ul><li>`list.groupBy(x => x.type) => [[...]]`</li><li>`new List(1, 2, 3).intersection([3, 4, 5]) => [3]`</li></ul> |
| Assert | Simple assertions with an optional configurable failure message. Examples: <ul><li>`Assert.notNull(variable)`</li><li>`Assert.that(number > 0, 'number was negative')`</li><li>`Assert.every(array, item => typeof item === 'string')`</li></ul> |
| Flags | Utilities that make working with flag-type enums easier. Examples: <ul><li>`Flags.has(flags, Flag.MyFlag) => true`</li></ul> |
| Fluent | WIP. Fluent API. Examples: <ul><li>`is(value).oneOf(Enum.One, Enum.Two, Enum.Four) => true`</li></ul> |
| Numbers | Accurate floating point comparisons, versioning, ranges, integer/float checks, and various mathematical complements to [`Math`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math). Examples: <ul><li>`Numbers.compare(0, 0.00000001) => true`</li><li>`Numbers.range(0, 20).relative(5) => 0.25`</li><li>`Numbers.sum(2, 4, 8) => 14`</li></ul> |
| Objects | Deep object comparisons, object schema checks, and much more. <ul><li>`Objects.compare({ a: 1 }, { a: 1 }) => true`</li><li>`Objects.isObjectLiteral(new Date()) => false`</li><li>`Objects.structure({ a: 1 }, { a: 'number' }) => true`</li></ul> |
| Strings | String checks and manipulations such as URL checking like <ul><li>`Strings.strip('banana bear', 'na', ' ') => 'babear'`</li><li>`Strings.takeUntil('myGroup:myValue', ':') => 'myGroup'`</li></ul> |
| Types | Convenience types for TypeScript users. <ul><li>`Nullable<string> // string \|â€ƒnull \| undefined`</li><li>`Constructor<BaseClass> // denotes abstract constructor`</li><li>`Instantiable<BaseClass> // denotes "newable" constructor`</li></ul> |

## Usage

### Installation

Simply run

```bash
npm install potence
```

or

```bash
yarn install potence
```

### Submodule imports

The way you import and use *potence* is up to you. You can use submodule imports:

```js
import * as Arrays from 'potence/arrays';

Arrays.equal([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]); // true
```

Since potence offers utility functions for each major data type, this allows you to immediately
identify which data type a set of functions belongs to and get code suggestions only for that
type. It also prevents name clashes between modules.

### Main entry imports

Alternatively, you can simply import from the main module entry. This will also allow you to capitalize
on your IDE's or code editor's import completion. However, you won't be able to use non-namespaced modules this way:

```js
import { Arrays } from 'potence';

Arrays.equal([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]); // true
```

**Note for webpack users**: It is strongly recommended that you [migrate to webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/) if you'd like to
use main module imports. This is because webpack 4 does not support tree-shaking for re-exported modules, which means
that, in this example, all `Arrays` functions would be added to your bundle despite the fact you only use `Arrays.equal()`.
webpack 5 only ever bundles the functions you actually use.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain *potence*'s original paradigms, there are a series of guidelines you should read and keep if you'd
like to contribute to the project:

* **Size.** Using any given *potence* function should not increase the resulting build size by a large margin. To ensure that it doesn't,
  functions must be kept as small as possible. If your idea does not fit a single function, consider creating a standalone package for it.
* **Generalization.** All functions must be kept as generalized as possible to ensure that a wide variety of projects can use them in their
  code base and to avoid bloating *potence*. A function tailored for a very specific use case may not be suitable for *potence*. When in
  doubt, open an issue and we can discuss the idea together.
* **Function number.** To ensure a good developing experience, there should a) not be too many modules and b) not be too many functions
  per module so as to not bloat the IDE's code completion lists and make it harder for the user to find the function they need.
* **Documentation.** Each module and function must be thoroughly documented. Any user should be able to understand what the function does
  without any prior knowledge aside from JavaScript basics. Include examples if the usage is unclear. *Only relevant on pull requests.*
* **Tests.** Functions without 100% line coverage will not be accepted. *Only relevant on pull requests.*
