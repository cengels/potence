## Constructor

```ts
new Range(from: number, to: number)
```

<div class="description">
    <p>Creates a range from the given number to another.</p>

    <p markdown="span">Note that `from` does not necessarily need to be smaller than `to`.
    If it is greater, the range is considered inverted.</p>
</div>

## Public Properties

                Clamps `value` to this range. If `value` exceeds the range's bounds,
                it will be clamped to that bound, otherwise `value` is returned unchanged.
            </p>

            <p markdown="span">A number is considered *contained* by the range if it lies in-between or on the bounds of this range.</p>
            <p markdown="span">This function allows you to specify a tolerance to combat floating point inaccuracies. By default a tolerance of `0.00000001` is used. The tolerance does not need to be a decimal number thoughâ€”you can specify arbitrary positive or negative tolerances to expand or narrow the range before the contains check.</p>

        </td>
        <td class="description">
            <p>Checks if the number is in-between the end points of this range.</p>
            <p markdown="span">This function differs from `contains()` in that `contains()` also considers values on the two end points to be "inside" the range. This function does not.</p>
            <p markdown="span">It is recommended not to use this function with floating point numbers. Use `contains()` with an appropriate tolerance instead.</p>

            Finds the intersection point closest to this range's center with the given range. If this range completely envelops the target range, returns this range's center.

            <p>Gets the union between this range and range as a new Range. If there is no true union (that is, the two ranges do not intersect), the returned Range will "bridge the gap", so to speak, acting as if either of the ranges were large enough to meet the other.</p>
            <p markdown="span">For example, a `Range(0, 3)` unioning with a `Range(2, 5)` will return a new `Range(0, 5)`.</p>

            <p markdown="span">If this range intersects with `range`, gets the total distance that this range should be moved so that it no longer intersects with `range`. This function will always choose the shortest distance. The distance can be negative. If the ranges don't intersect, the return value will be 0.</p>
            <p markdown="span">For example, a `Range(0, 3)` and a `Range(2, 5)` will return an offset of `-1` ("move this range backwards by 1 to get `Range(-1, 2)`, thus no longer intersecting with the other range").</p>

## Remarks

Note that all computed properties like `min()` or `max()` are cached after the
first call and only recomputed if the range bounds change. As a result, there is
no need to store their results in temporary variables to avoid recomputation.

There is also a read-only interface of `Range` available called `ReadonlyRange`.

Due to conflicts with the
[`Range`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/b5b0437a86661c8d7bc76c5860c07305df17899c/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L12437)
from `lib.dom.d.ts`, you may wish to create a new range using
[`Numbers.range()`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/Numbers/range_func.md %})
instead of using the constructor directly.
